## The Unofficial SSC Meetup Repository

*Last updated: 2017-04-14*

### What is this?

This is an **unofficial** community maintained listing of [SlateStarCodex Meetups Everywhere](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/03/ssc-meetups-everywhere-times-and-places/).
[SlateStarCodex is a blog that we like](http://slatestarcodex.com/). You can read about origins of these meetups [here](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/27/ssc-meetup-everywhere/).

Our listing is based on [this post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/03/ssc-meetups-everywhere-times-and-places/).
We try to update the information of meetups, but we can't guarantee their veracity.
If the meetup has some kind of contact details listed, we encourage that you try to contact them directly.

### Your information is outdated!

If you see outdated information / want to get your email off the list / have a suggestion, please create an [issue](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/issues) or (if you know how to github) a [pull request](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/pulls).

### How to use this repository?

Our current solution is very simple and low-tech (this is on purpose).

Press `Ctrl-F` in your web browser, and search for a location nearby you.

Our format is as follows: [Optional fields in brackets like this.]

```
* Meetup location (city)
    * [Additional search keywords:] Country, (anything else you think is relevant)
    * Last scheduled meetup: Saturday, April 8 2017, 2017,  7  PM  (the last scheduled meetup that we know of, local time)
    * Location: Description of location for ^
    * Contact: Contact details like email, FB group, Meetup.com, website, blog, anything. Links: [link name](http://www.google.com)
    * [Next meetup planned:] (date if we know it)
    * [Regular meetups:] (any information we have if the meetups happen regularly)
```

and it looks like this:

    * [Additional search keywords:] Country, (anything else you think is relevant)
    * Last scheduled meetup: Saturday, April 8 2017, 2017,  7  PM  (the last scheduled meetup that we know of, local time)
