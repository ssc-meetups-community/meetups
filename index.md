## The Unofficial SSC Meetup Repository

[See here for map of meetup locations](https://www.mapcustomizer.com/map/SSC%20Meetups%207%2F2017)

[See here for meetup data commit history](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/commits/master)

### What is this?

This is an **unofficial** community maintained listing of [SlateStarCodex Meetups Everywhere](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/03/ssc-meetups-everywhere-times-and-places/).
[SlateStarCodex is a blog that we like](http://slatestarcodex.com/). You can read about origins of these meetups [here](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/27/ssc-meetup-everywhere/).

Our listing is based on [this post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/03/ssc-meetups-everywhere-times-and-places/).
We try to update the information of meetups, but we can't guarantee their veracity.
Especially the '(next) scheduled meetup' field is most likely *outdated*.
If the meetup has some kind of contact details (email, FB group, Google group, anything) listed, we encourage that you try to contact them directly.

### How to use this repository?

Our current solution is very simple and low-tech (this is on purpose): this is a simple text file with some added pretty html.

Press `Ctrl-F` in your web browser, and search for a location nearby you.

### I'm organizing a meetup, what I should do?

We'd appreciate if you created an external webpage (or similar) in the public internet that you regularly update, and [then tell us about it](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/issues) so that we can link to there.

Some popular platforms to advertise your meetup are e.g. [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/), [Google Group](https://groups.google.com), public Facebook event, public blog, [LessWrong meetup event](http://lesswrong.com/meetups/) , etc etc.

### Okay, I have a public webpage / FB event / Meetup.com / a Thing, what next?

Let us know!

1. If you have a GitHub account, [create an issue](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/issues). (Click the link, 'New Issue'.)
2. If you don't have a GitHub account / you don't want to create one, you can email the maintainer (currently [ssc-fans-hki](https://github.com/ssc-fans-hki) at sschelsinkimeetup a t gmail.com.)

### Your information is outdated!

If you see outdated information / want to get your email off the list / have a suggestion, please create an [issue](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/issues) (see above) or if you know how to github, a [pull request](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/pulls).

### Other SSC-aligned activities?

If you did not find any meetups near you on this list, do not despair.
You might consider checking if there's [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/meetups/) activity near you.
(Alternatively you could think about organizing your own event.
See [this](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/03/ssc-meetups-everywhere-times-and-places/) and [this](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/27/ssc-meetup-everywhere/) for advice.
Possible avenues for advertising / finding out if there are other SSC readers nearby: [the open thread](http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/open/?latest), [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/gpaTCxh).)

### RSS?

GitHub provides automagical Atom feed of changes to the repository master branch at [https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/commits/master.atom](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/commits/master.atom)


### How to contribute?

Our format is as follows: [Optional fields marked with brackets.]

```

    * [Regular meetups:] (any information we have if the meetups happen regularly)
