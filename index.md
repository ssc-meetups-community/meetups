## The Unofficial SSC Meetup Repository

**N.B. As of April 2018, this file is no longer actively updated. All users: please migrate to new [LW community page](https://www.lesswrong.com/community) at [https://www.lesswrong.com/community](https://www.lesswrong.com/community).**

**The meetup information below is archived for reference only.**

[See here for meetup data commit history](https://github.com/ssc-meetups-community/meetups/commits/master)

### What is this?

This was an **unofficial** community maintained listing of [SlateStarCodex Meetups Everywhere](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/03/ssc-meetups-everywhere-times-and-places/).
[SlateStarCodex is a blog that we like](http://slatestarcodex.com/). You can read about origins of these meetups [here](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/27/ssc-meetup-everywhere/).
The listing was based on [this post](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/04/03/ssc-meetups-everywhere-times-and-places/).

### How to use this repository?

Our current solution is very simple and low-tech (this is on purpose): this is a simple text file with some added pretty html.

Press `Ctrl-F` in your web browser, and search for a location nearby you.

### The SSC Meetups Everywhere: The Deprecated List

We meet almost every Tuesdays: Monthly, we have lectures or similar events; at a two-week offset from those we have "Game Nights" -- but you can also just come and hang out. Other Tuesdays, we often get together at a pub. We've been going strong for five or so years.
